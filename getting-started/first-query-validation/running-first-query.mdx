# Running Your First Query with GDBC

Welcome to your first step executing SQL queries using the GDBC (Generic Database Connectivity) framework. This guide walks you through writing, compiling, and running a simple Java program that connects to a database, executes a straightforward SQL query, and displays the result. By following this guide, you'll gain hands-on experience with GDBC’s core functionality and confirm your setup is running perfectly.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed (version 8 or higher recommended).
- **Apache Maven** installed for building the project.
- Access to a running **PostgreSQL database** on your local machine (or change connection details for your database).
- Basic familiarity with SQL and command-line operations.

If you have completed the installation of GDBC and set up native libraries as per the installation guides, you are ready to proceed.

---

## 2. Understanding the Example Code

The `SimpleTest.java` Java class demonstrates the core workflow for running your first SQL query through GDBC:

- Load the PostgreSQL JDBC driver.
- Establish a connection using your database URL and credentials.
- Create a SQL statement.
- Execute the query `SELECT 123;`.
- Retrieve and print the result.

Here is the key section:

```java
Driver d = (Driver) Class.forName("org.postgresql.Driver").newInstance();
Properties info = new Properties();
info.put("user", "root");
info.put("password", "password");
Connection conn = d.connect("jdbc:postgresql://localhost/test?loggerLevel=DEBUG", info);

try (Statement stmt = conn.createStatement(); ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT 123;")) {
    rs.next();
    System.out.println("result: " + rs.getInt(1));
}
```

The program prints logs at important stages to the console to help you follow progress.

## 3. Compile and Run Your Query

Follow these step-by-step instructions to run the sample:

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to the project directory">
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `SimpleTest.java` file.
</Step>

<Step title="Compile the project">
Run Maven to compile the Java sources and build the classpath:

```bash
mvn compile
```

This command compiles `SimpleTest.java` into the `target/classes` directory.
</Step>

<Step title="Set the classpath and run the test">
Use the following shell script commands (adjusted for your environment) to run the query:

```bash
CLASSPATH="$(mvn -q exec:exec -Dexec.executable=echo -Dexec.args='%classpath'):$(cd target/classes && pwd)"
java -cp "$CLASSPATH" SimpleTest "org.postgresql.Driver" "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/test?loggerLevel=DEBUG" "root" "password" "SELECT 1;"
```

You should see output similar to:

```
starting
got driver
connected
result: 1
done
```

This confirms your application connected successfully, executed the query, and retrieved results.
</Step>
</Steps>

---

## 4. Modifying the Query

To run your own queries, you can change the SQL statement in `SimpleTest.java` inside the `executeQuery` method call. For example:

```java
try (Statement stmt = conn.createStatement(); ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT current_date;")) {
    rs.next();
    System.out.println("Today's date: " + rs.getString(1));
}
```

Recompile and run to see the new output.

## 5. Key Tips and Best Practices

- Use **loggerLevel=DEBUG** in your JDBC URL to enable detailed driver logs helpful for troubleshooting.
- Store your credentials securely. This example uses hardcoded values for demonstration only.
- Close your connections and resources properly to avoid leaks. `try-with-resources` ensures this.
- Customize the database URL when connecting to other databases supported by GDBC.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Driver Not Found Exception">
Make sure the PostgreSQL JDBC driver dependency is included in your Maven `pom.xml`. Check the classpath settings if the driver fails to load.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Connection Failure">

- Verify the database is running and accessible at the provided URL.
- Check username and password correctness.
- Confirm no firewall or network rules block connections on port 5432 by default.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Query Returns No Results or Errors">

- Validate your SQL syntax.
- Confirm the database contains the queried data.
- Enable debug logging (`loggerLevel=DEBUG`) for detailed error traces.

</Accordion>
