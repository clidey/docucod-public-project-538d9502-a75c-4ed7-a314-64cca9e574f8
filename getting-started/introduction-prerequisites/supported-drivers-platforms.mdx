# Supported Drivers & Platforms

GDBC offers a robust set of pre-packaged and tested database drivers designed to provide reliable, high-performance connectivity to popular relational database management systems. This page details the supported drivers, the databases they connect to, and the platforms on which they are compatible.

---

## 1. Overview of Supported Database Drivers

GDBC currently supports the following major database drivers out of the box:

- **Microsoft SQL Server**
- **Oracle Database**
- **PostgreSQL**

Each driver is carefully wrapped and pre-built for native integration with GDBC, ensuring compatibility and stability.

<Tip>
You don’t need to manually download or configure these drivers. GDBC delivers them fully packaged for immediate use across supported platforms.
</Tip>

- **Driver Version:** 7.3.0.jre8-preview
- **Driver Class:** `com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver`

### Key Features
- Supports the latest SQL Server authentication protocols.
- Includes runtime class initialization tuning to optimize native image builds.
- Configured with resources for localization and error reporting.

### Platform Compatibility
- **Linux:** Supported and packaged as `libgdbc-mssql.so`.
- **macOS:** Supported, provided as `libgdbc-mssql.dylib`.

---

## 3. Oracle Database Driver

### Driver Details
- Fully supported Oracle JDBC driver wrapped with necessary native configurations.
- Includes extended driver classes such as `oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CDriverExtension` to fully support Oracle's advanced functionalities.

### Platform Compatibility
- Available for Linux and macOS platforms.

---

## 4. PostgreSQL Driver

### Driver Details
- **Driver Class:** `org.postgresql.Driver`
- Configured with selective class initialization for optimized boot time.
- Offers debug logging capabilities for easier troubleshooting during development.

### Platform Compatibility
- Packaged for native usage on Linux and macOS with shared libraries named like `libgdbc-postgresql.so` or `libgdbc-postgresql.dylib`.

## 5. MySQL & MariaDB Driver Ecosystem (Upcoming and Community Contributions)

While MySQL and MariaDB drivers are not officially pre-packaged in the current stable release, GDBC maintains wrapper scripts and configurations for:

- **MySQL Connector/J versions 5.1.47 and 6.0.6**
- **MariaDB JDBC driver**

These wrapper scripts handle native image configuration, reflection metadata, and resource bundling necessary for native compilation.

<Tip>
Community efforts and future releases will expand official support for these drivers. Check the project repository for the latest build scripts and configurations.
</Tip>

## 6. Platform Compatibility Matrix

| Platform  | Microsoft SQL Server | Oracle Database | PostgreSQL | MySQL (Community) | MariaDB (Community) |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Linux     | Yes                 | Yes             | Yes        | Scripts available | Scripts available    |
| macOS     | Yes                 | Yes             | Yes        | Scripts available | Scripts available    |
| Windows   | Planned             | Planned         | Planned    | Planned           | Planned             |

<Tip>
Support for Windows platforms is under active development and will be announced in future updates.
</Tip>

## 7. How Drivers are Packaged and Built

GDBC uses automated build scripts to wrap each JDBC driver into a native code library via GraalVM native-image technology. This process includes:

- Compiling Java driver classes with necessary reflection and resource configuration.
- Building shared libraries (`.so` for Linux, `.dylib` for macOS) that GDBC can load directly.
- Including debugging support and runtime initialization tuning for optimal performance.

### Example Build Command (PostgreSQL)

```bash
mvn compile

CLASSPATH="$(mvn -q exec:exec -Dexec.executable=echo -Dexec.args='%classpath'):$(cd target/classes && pwd)"

native-image --no-server \
  --report-unsupported-elements-at-runtime \
  --allow-incomplete-classpath \
  -H:+ReportExceptionStackTraces \
  --initialize-at-build-time=com.sun.jna.platform.win32.Win32Exception,com.sun.jna.LastErrorException,org.postgresql.Driver,org.postgresql.core.Logger,org.postgresql.util.SharedTimer \
  -cp $CLASSPATH \
  -H:Name=simpletest SimpleTest

./simpletest "org.postgresql.Driver" "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/test?loggerLevel=DEBUG" "root" "password" "SELECT 1;"
```

<Tip>
Refer to the `wrapper/scripts/` directory in the [GDBC GitHub repository](https://github.com/identitii/gdbc) for driver-specific build scripts.
</Tip>

## 8. Best Practices & Recommendations

- Always use the pre-packaged drivers unless you have a specific need to customize or build your own.
- Keep your GDBC installation updated to benefit from the latest driver updates and platform improvements.
- Test your target database connectivity using the provided drivers before deploying to production.
- For development, enable debug logging (where supported) to simplify troubleshooting.

## 9. Troubleshooting Driver Compatibility

<AccordionGroup title="Common Driver & Platform Issues">
<Accordion title="Driver Not Loading or Found">
- Verify your application points to the correct driver class name as documented.
- Confirm that the native driver libraries exist in the expected platform-specific paths.
- Confirm that no conflicting drivers are loaded in the environment.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Authentication Failures">
- Ensure your database credentials and URLs follow correct syntax.
- Check if additional runtime options are needed for your database driver authentication.
- Consult error logs for detailed diagnostic messages.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Platform Compatibility Errors">
- Verify your OS matches the supported platform for the driver.
- For macOS and Linux, verify correct shared library permissions.
- Windows support is in progress; use workarounds cautiously.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
If problems persist, consult the Troubleshooting Installation & Setup guide in the Getting Started section for comprehensive diagnostics.
